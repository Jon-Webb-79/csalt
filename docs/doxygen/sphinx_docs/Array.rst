Arrays

The ``array.h`` header file offers a comprehensive suite of functions for 
managing statically allocated arrays in C. Unlike dynamic arrays, these static 
arrays have a fixed size, determined at compile-time, making them a key tool 
in scenarios where data sizes are known and constant.

Statically allocated arrays are stored on the stack, leading to faster access 
for small and fixed-size data sets. They are ideal for applications where 
deterministic memory usage and efficiency are paramount, albeit with the 
trade-off of a fixed capacity.

Key Features
------------

- **Array Initialization and Population:** Simplify the process of initializing and populating arrays with values.
- **Searching and Sorting:** Tailored efficient algorithms for searching and sorting fixed-size data sets.
- **Data Manipulation:** Facilitate the insertion, deletion, and modification of elements within fixed-size constraints.
- **Utility Functions:** Various helper functions for common array tasks, such as finding minimum/maximum values or calculating averages.

These utilities enhance the usability of statically allocated arrays, making 
them more practical and effective for a range of programming tasks in C. 
The ``array.h`` file is especially useful in contexts where memory efficiency 
and performance are critical, and the data size is known and consistent.
