Doubly Linked List
********************

The ``dlist.h`` header file provides an implementation of the Doubly Linked List
data structure in C. A Doubly Linked List is an enhanced version of the singly
linked list, where each node contains data, a pointer to the next node, and a
pointer to the previous node in the sequence. This bi-directional linkage
facilitates more versatile traversals and operations, allowing efficient
insertion, deletion, and access from both ends of the list.

Doubly Linked Lists are particularly useful for:

- **Bidirectional Traversal**: Unlike Singly Linked Lists, Doubly Linked Lists
  allow traversal in both forward and backward directions, making them suitable
  for applications that require reverse iteration or navigation through the data.

- **Efficient Element Insertion and Deletion**: With pointers to both the next
  and previous nodes, elements can be added or removed from both ends of the
  list and at any position within the list with relative ease and efficiency.

- **Implementation of Complex Data Structures**: The versatility of Doubly
  Linked Lists makes them ideal for creating sophisticated data structures like
  doubly-ended queues, linked lists with both LIFO (Last In, First Out) and
  FIFO (First In, First Out) characteristics, and for facilitating easier
  cursor movement in text editors.

- **Enhanced Flexibility for Dynamic Data Management**: They provide a dynamic
  data storage solution capable of expanding and contracting as needed, without
  the fixed size limitations of arrays. This makes Doubly Linked Lists suitable
  for managing collections of data where the volume may change over time.

The ``dlist.h`` library provides functions to create, manage, and interact with
Doubly Linked Lists, offering developers enhanced control and flexibility over
data management processes. Key characteristics of a Doubly Linked List include:

- Each node contains a data field, a pointer to the next node (forward link),
  and a pointer to the previous node (backward link), creating a network of
  nodes that can be navigated in both directions.

- The first node of the list, known as the "head," has its previous pointer set
  to `NULL`, and the last node, or "tail," has its next pointer set to `NULL`.

- Operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal are more efficient
  in certain scenarios compared to singly linked lists, especially when
  removing nodes from the end of the list or when traversing the list in reverse.

- Doubly Linked Lists allow for O(1) time complexity for insertions and deletions
  at both ends of the list and have an O(n/2) time complexity for operations at
  arbitrary positions, where `n` is the number of elements in the list.

This library extends the capabilities of traditional linked list structures,
providing a powerful tool for developers to handle complex data management
tasks with greater ease and efficiency.
