Over the next few months it is my intention to add the following functionality
to the Csalt library.

#. **Matrix:** A library to enable 2-D Matrices with basic functionality such as
   dot products, cross products, matrix transpose, multi-equation solvers and 
   partial differential equation solvers.

#. **Single Linke List:** A library that enables singly linked lists.  This
   section will mimic the behavior of a vector as applied to a singly linked 
   list with no reverse iteration capability.

#. **Double Linked List:** A library that enables double linked lists.  This 
   section will mimic the behavior of a vector as applied to a double linked 
   list.

#. **Priority Queue:** A library that enable priority queue's.

#. **Binary Tree:** A library that enable an AVL Binary Tree with search
   algorithms.

#. **Hash Table:** A library that enables has tables with string keys and 
   all types of data.

#. **Graph Structure:** A library that enables a graph data structure with basic 
   functionality.

#. **Random:** A library that enables a very long period random number generator 
   developed by the Los Alamos National Library for the MCNP radiation transport 
   code.

#. **Read Files:** A library that provides a common interface for reading 
   configuration files to inlcude yaml, xml, and json files.  In addition,
   this portion of the library will allow for the reading of columnar data 
   from .csv and .xlsx files.

#. **Database:** A library to enable reasing from SQLite, MySQL, and PostGreSQL
   databases.
