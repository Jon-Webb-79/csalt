AVL Tree
********************

The ``avl.h`` header file provides an implementation of the AVL Tree data structure 
in C. An AVL Tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree where the height 
of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by no more than one. This 
balance is maintained through rotations during insertions and deletions, 
ensuring that the tree remains optimally balanced for efficient search operations.

AVL Trees are particularly useful for:

- **Efficient Search Operations**: Thanks to their self-balancing nature, AVL Trees maintain an O(log n) search time complexity, making them ideal for applications that require fast search, insert, and delete operations.

- **Maintaining Ordered Data**: AVL Trees store data in a sorted manner, allowing for efficient in-order traversal of elements, which is crucial for range queries and sorted data retrieval.

- **Dynamic Data Set Management**: They dynamically adjust their structure via rotations to maintain balance, which is critical for handling intermediately changing data sets where insertions and deletions happen frequently.

- **Implementation of Priority Queues**: Due to their ordered nature and efficient insertion and deletion capabilities, AVL Trees are well-suited for implementing priority queues where elements need to be accessed and removed in a sorted order.

- **Enhanced Performance for Read-Intensive Applications**: AVL Trees are particularly advantageous in scenarios where the data structure undergoes frequent read operations, as their balanced nature ensures consistently quick access times.

The ``avl.h`` library offers functions to create, manage, and interact with AVL 
Trees, providing developers with enhanced capabilities for handling data efficiently. 
Key characteristics of an AVL Tree include:

- **Self-Balancing Capability**: Each node in the AVL Tree automatically maintains a balance factor (the height difference between its left and right subtree) that is used to perform rotations and ensure the tree remains balanced after insertions and deletions.

- **Rotations for Balancing**: Simple rotations (left, right) and double rotations (left-right, right-left) are utilized to maintain tree balance, enhancing the overall performance of dynamic data operations.

- **Logarithmic Height**: The maximum height of an AVL Tree is bound by 1.44 logâ‚‚(n+2), ensuring that operations like search, insert, and delete can be performed in logarithmic time complexity.

- **Node Structure**: Each node contains a data field, pointers to the left and right children, and often a balance factor or height information to aid in maintaining the tree's balance.

This library extends the capabilities of traditional binary search trees by 
ensuring that operations are carried out with maximum efficiency, regardless of 
the sequence of insertions and deletions, thus providing a robust tool for 
developers to manage ordered data structures effectively.
